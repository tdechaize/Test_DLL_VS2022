# Test_DLL_VS2022
Generate DLL and test (multiples tests)

Initials objectives : code and test DLL in which entry point is used, multiple functions defined, and call of these functions are "natural" : only by the name of function (with not decorations : "_" before or after, or "@nn" in suffix of the name of function).

Results : all tests DLL are good with this compiler.
